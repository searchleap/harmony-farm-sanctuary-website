2. **Create UserManagement Component**
   - User account creation and editing
   - Role-based permission management
   - User activity tracking and analytics
   - Bulk user operations and import/export

### Phase 2: Volunteer Application System (30 mins)
3. **Create VolunteerApplications Component**
   - Application form builder and management
   - Application review and approval workflow
   - Volunteer onboarding process
   - Background check and document management

4. **Create VolunteerProfiles Component**
   - Comprehensive volunteer profiles
   - Skills and certifications tracking
   - Availability and preference management
   - Volunteer history and achievements

### Phase 3: Scheduling & Communication (25 mins)
5. **Create VolunteerScheduling Component**
   - Event creation and volunteer assignment
