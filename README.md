## Getting Started

The project uses TaskMaster for organized development with 25 carefully planned tasks. Each task includes:
- Clear objectives and acceptance criteria
- Dependency management
- Testing strategies
- Detailed implementation notes

### TaskMaster Integration Issues
Currently experiencing MCP error handling issues with the TaskMaster server that prevent automated task management. Tasks have been manually created and are tracked in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`.

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priority**: Begin Phase 1 with Task 1 (Project Setup and Development Environment)

1. Set up React/TypeScript/Vite project structure
2. Configure Tailwind CSS and styling system
3. Establish development environment and build process
4. Create initial project scaffolding

**Milestone Confirmation**: After completing each phase, confirm progress and get approval for next steps.
