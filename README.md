## Getting Started

The project uses TaskMaster for organized development with 25 carefully planned tasks. Each task includes:
- Clear objectives and acceptance criteria
- Dependency management
- Testing strategies
- Detailed implementation notes

### TaskMaster Integration Issues
Currently experiencing MCP error handling issues with the TaskMaster server that prevent automated task management. Tasks have been manually created and are tracked in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`.

## Development Status
