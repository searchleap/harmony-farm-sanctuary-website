# Step 7.3: Content Versioning & Approval Workflow

## Overview
Implement comprehensive content versioning and approval workflow system for FAQ and Resource content management.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Version Control Infrastructure (30 mins)
1. **Extend Type Definitions**
   - Add versioning interfaces (`ContentVersion`, `VersionDiff`, `WorkflowState`)
   - Extend FAQ and Resource types with version tracking
   - Add approval workflow states and transitions

2. **Create ContentVersionControl Component**
   - Version history display with timeline
   - Diff visualization between versions
   - Rollback functionality with confirmation
   - Version comparison side-by-side view

### Phase 2: Approval Workflow System (30 mins)
3. **Create ApprovalWorkflow Component**
   - Multi-stage workflow visualization
   - Role-based approval actions
   - Progress tracking and status indicators
   - Approval comments and feedback

4. **Create ChangeTracker Component**
   - Automated change detection
   - Field-level change highlighting
   - Change summary generation
   - Integration with version control

### Phase 3: Workflow Dashboard (15 mins)
5. **Create WorkflowDashboard Component**
   - Overview of all content in workflow
   - Filtering by workflow stage
   - Bulk workflow actions
   - Performance metrics and analytics

6. **Integration & Testing**
   - Integrate with existing FAQ and Resource systems
   - Add workflow controls to admin interface
   - Test all components together
   - Update routing and navigation

## Workflow States
- **Draft**: Initial content creation
- **Review**: Submitted for review
- **Approved**: Content approved for publication
- **Published**: Live content accessible to users
- **Archived**: Removed from public view

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All components compile without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Version history tracks all content changes
- ✅ Approval workflow enforces proper permissions
- ✅ Dashboard provides clear workflow overview
- ✅ Integration with existing admin system
- ✅ Mobile responsive design

## Timeline
- **Start**: Step 7.3 implementation
- **Duration**: ~75 minutes
- **Completion**: Ready for Step 7.4 (User Feedback System)
